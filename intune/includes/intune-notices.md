These notices provide important information that can help you prepare for future Intune changes and features.

### <a name="update-your-intune-outlook-app-protection-policies-app--2576686--"></a>Update your Intune Outlook App protection policies (APP)<!--2576686-->
You may need to take action if you received MC195618 In your Message Center. As shared in Microsoft 365 roadmap feature IDs: 56325 and 56326, Intune and Outlook for iOS and Android are rolling out support for limiting sensitive data in mail notifications and calendar reminders. As a result of these improvements, Outlook for iOS and Android will be removing support for several data protection app configuration keys you are currently leveraging to manage notifications.

#### <a name="how-does-this-affect-me"></a>Bu değişiklik beni nasıl etkileyecek?
While the new features have not shipped, when they do, the following app configuration keys will no longer function in Outlook for iOS and Android:
- com.microsoft.outlook.Mail.NotificationsEnabled
- com.microsoft.outlook.Mail.NotificationsEnabled.UserChangeAllowed
- com.microsoft.outlook.Calendar.NotificationsEnabled
- com.microsoft.outlook.Calendar.NotificationsEnabled.UserChangeAllowed

#### <a name="what-do-i-need-to-do-to-prepare-for-this-change"></a>Bu değişikliğe hazırlanmak için ne yapmam gerek?
We recommend you configure the Intune App Protection Policy data protection setting “Org data notifications” with a value of “Block Org Data” in preparation for this new feature. Beginning on December 16, 2019, Outlook for iOS and Android will honor the “Org data notifications” data protection setting and no longer support the aforementioned keys. Configuring this new setting will ensure sensitive data is not leaked when the above configuration keys are no longer supported. Additionally, Outlook is providing additional granularity when the data protection setting “Org data notifications” is set to “Block Org Data” with an additional app configuration setting, “Calendar notifications”. The combination of the App Protection Policy setting and this app configuration setting limits sensitive information in mail notifications, while exposing sensitive information in calendar notifications, so that users can get to their meetings by glancing quickly at the notification or notification center.

### <a name="intune-plan-for-change-windows-10-version-1703-company-portal-moving-out-of-support--5026679--"></a>Intune Plan for Change: Windows 10, version 1703 Company Portal moving out of Support<!--5026679-->
Windows 10, version 1703 (also known as Windows 10, RS2) has moved out of service on October 8, 2019 for enterprise and EDU editions. Intune will end support for the corresponding Company Portal app for RS2/RS1 starting on December 26, 2019.

#### <a name="how-does-this-affect-me"></a>Bu değişiklik beni nasıl etkileyecek?
Moving forward, you will not see new features in the specific version of the Company Portal app, although we will continue to support this version of the Company Portal app through December 26, 2019, including providing any security updates to the Company Portal app as needed. However, since Windows 10, version 1703 will not receive any security updates once it moves out of servicing, we highly recommend you update your Windows devices to a more recent Windows version and make sure you’re on the latest Company Portal app so you continue to get new features and additional functionality.

#### <a name="what-do-i-need-to-do-to-prepare-for-this-change"></a>Bu değişikliğe hazırlanmak için ne yapmam gerek?
The steps you take depends on how your environment is configured. In general though, you should identify the devices that have the older version of the OS and/or the Company Portal on their device, and update. To set your Windows 10 update rings, log into Intune -> Software updates – Windows 10 update rings. The latest version of the Company Portal is version 10.3.5601.0. Please direct your users to acquire it from the Microsoft Store to stay up to date with future releases. You can also use Intune to install the latest on your Windows devices through the [Microsoft Store for Business](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/windows-store-for-business).

### <a name="take-action-use-microsoft-edge-for-your-protected-intune-browser-experience--5728447--"></a>Take Action: Use Microsoft Edge for your Protected Intune Browser Experience<!--5728447-->
As we have been sharing over the past year, Microsoft Edge mobile supports the same set of management features as the Managed Browser, while providing a much-improved end user experience. To make way for the robust experiences provided in Microsoft Edge, we will be retiring the Intune Managed Browser. Starting on January, 27, 2020, Intune will no longer support the Intune Managed Browser.  

#### <a name="how-does-this-affect-me"></a>Bu değişiklik beni nasıl etkileyecek? 
Starting on February 1, 2020, the Intune Managed Browser will no longer be available in the Google Play Store or the iOS App Store. At this point, you will still be able to target new app protection policies to the Intune Managed Browser, though new users won't be able to download the Intune Managed Browser app. In addition, on iOS, new web clips that are pushed down to MDM-enrolled device will open in Microsoft Edge instead of the Intune Managed Browser.  

On March, 31 2020, the Intune Managed Browser will be removed from the Azure console. This means you will no longer be able to create new policies for the Intune Managed Browser. If you have existing Intune Managed Browser policies in place, they won't be affected. The Intune Managed Browser will show up in the console as an LOB app with no icon, and existing policies will show as targeted to the app still. At this point, we will also remove the option to redirect web content to the Intune Managed Browser within the Data Protection section of App protection policies.  

#### <a name="what-do-i-need-to-do-to-prepare-for-this-change"></a>Bu değişikliğe hazırlanmak için ne yapmam gerek? 
To ensure a smooth transition from the Intune Managed Browser to Microsoft Edge, we recommend you take the following steps proactively: 

1. Target Microsoft Edge for iOS and Android with app protection policy (also referred to as MAM)  and app config settings. You can reuse your Intune Managed Browser policies for Microsoft Edge by targeting those existing policies to Microsoft Edge as well.  
2. Ensure all MAM-protected apps in your environment have the app protection policy setting "Restrict web content transfer with other apps" set to "Policy managed browsers". 
3. Target all the MAM-protected with the managed app configuration setting "com.microsoft.intune.useEdge" set to true. Starting next month with the release of 1911, you will be able to accomplish steps 2 and 3 simply by configuring the setting "Restrict web content transfer with other apps" to have "Microsoft Edge" selected in the Data Protection section of your app protection policies. 

Support for web clips on iOS and Android is coming. When this support is released, you will need to retarget pre-existing web clips to ensure they open in in Microsoft Edge instead of the Managed Browser.

### <a name="plan-for-change-updated-experience-when-enrolling-android-enterprise-dedicated-devices-in-intune--5198878--"></a>Plan for Change: Updated experience when enrolling Android Enterprise dedicated devices in Intune<!--5198878-->
With the November or 1911 release to Intune, we’re adding support for SCEP device certificate deployment to Android Enterprise dedicated devices to enable certificate-based access to Wi-Fi profiles. This change also involves some minor changes the flow when enrolling Android Enterprise dedicated devices.

#### <a name="how-does-this-affect-me"></a>Bu değişiklik beni nasıl etkileyecek?
If you manage Android Enterprise dedicated devices in your environment, you will start to see some changes roll out in November.

- For new Android Enterprise dedicated device enrollments: End users will see a different set of steps on devices during enrollment. Enrollment will still start the way it does today (with QR, NFC, Zero-touch, or device identifier) but after the November service release, there will be a mandatory app install step.
- For existing Android devices enrolled as dedicated devices: Intune will start to automatically install the Microsoft Intune app on devices starting in early November. You don't need to take any action. The app will automatically download and install on devices. 

#### <a name="what-can-i-do-to-prepare-for-this-change"></a>Bu değişikliğe hazırlanmak için ne yapabilirim?
You should plan to update your end user guidance and let your helpdesk know of this change. Click Additional Information for more details and screenshots. We’ll update our What’s New page when this change starts to roll out.

### <a name="end-of-support-for-legacy-pc-management"></a>End of support for legacy PC management

Legacy PC management is going out of support on October 15, 2020. Upgrade devices to Windows 10 and reenroll them as Mobile Device Management (MDM) devices to keep them managed by Intune.

### <a name="decreasing-support-for-android-device-administrator"></a>Decreasing support for Android device administrator 
Android device administrator (sometimes referred to "legacy" Android management and released with Android 2.2) is a way to manage Android devices. However, improved management functionality is now available with [Android Enterprise](../enrollment/connect-intune-android-enterprise.md) (released with Android 5.0). In an effort to move to modern, richer, and more secure device management, Google is decreasing device administrator support in new Android releases.

#### <a name="how-does-this-affect-me"></a>Bu değişiklik beni nasıl etkileyecek?
Because of these changes by Google, Intune users will be impacted in the following ways:  
- Intune will only be able to provide support for device administrator-managed Android devices running Android 10 and later (also known as Android Q) through the summer of 2020. This date is when the next major version of Android is expected to be released.   
- Device administrator-managed devices that are running Android 10 or later after the summer of 2020 will no longer be able to be entirely managed.       
- Device administrator-managed Android devices that remain on Android versions below Android 10 won't be impacted and can continue to be entirely managed with device administrator.    
- For all devices running Android 10 and later, Google has restricted the ability for device administrator management agents like Company Portal to access device identifier information. This restriction impacts the following Intune features after a device updates to Android 10 or later:  
    - Network access control for VPN will no longer work.   
    - Identifying devices as corporate-owned with an IMEI or serial number won't automatically mark devices as corporate-owned.  
    - The IMEI and serial number will no longer be visible to IT admins in Intune. 
        > [!NOTE]
        > This only impacts device administrator-managed devices on Android 10 and later and does not affect devices being managed as Android Enterprise. 

#### <a name="what-do-i-need-to-do-to-prepare-for-this-change"></a>Bu değişikliğe hazırlanmak için ne yapmam gerek?
To avoid the reduction in functionality coming in the summer of 2020, we recommend the following:
- Don't onboard new devices into device administrator management.
- If a device is expected to receive an update to Android 10, migrate it off of device administrator management to Android Enterprise management and/or app protection policies.

### <a name="plan-for-change-intune-app-sdk-and-app-protection-policies-for-android-moving-to-support-android-50-and-higher-in-an-upcoming-release---4911065---"></a>Plan for change: Intune App SDK and app protection policies for Android moving to support Android 5.0 and higher in an upcoming release <!--4911065 -->
Intune will be moving to support Android 5.x (Lollipop) and higher in an upcoming release. Update any wrapped apps with the latest Intune App SDK and update your devices.

#### <a name="how-does-this-affect-me"></a>Bu değişiklik beni nasıl etkileyecek?
If you're not using or plan to use either the SDK or APP for Android, this change won't affect you. If you are using the Intune App SDK, be sure to update to the latest version and also update your devices to Android 5.x and higher. If you don't update, apps won't receive updates, and the quality of their experience will diminish over time.

Below find a list of common devices enrolled in Intune that run Android version 4.x. If you have one of these devices, take the appropriate steps to make sure that this device will support Android version 5.0 or higher or that it will be replaced with a device that supports Android version 5.0 or higher. This list is not exhaustive of all devices that may need to be evaluated:

- Samsung SM-T561  
- Samsung SM-T365
- Samsung GT-I9195
- Samsung SM-G800F
- Samsung SM-G357FZ
- Motorola XT1080
- Samsung GT-I9305
- Samsung SM-T231

#### <a name="what-do-i-need-to-do-to-prepare-for-this-change"></a>Bu değişikliğe hazırlanmak için ne yapmam gerek?
Wrap your apps with the latest Intune App SDK. You may also set the "Require minimum OS version (Warning only)" conditional launch setting to notify end users on personal devices to upgrade.

### <a name="intune-plan-for-change-nearing-end-of-support-for-windows-7---3042987---"></a>Intune plan for change: Nearing end of support for Windows 7<!-- 3042987 -->
As we messaged in MC148476, posted last September 2018, and again in MC176794 back in March 2019, Windows 7 reaches its end of extended support on January 14, 2020. At that time, Intune will retire support for devices running Windows 7 so we can focus our investment on supporting newer technologies and providing great new end-user experiences. After that date, technical assistance and automatic updates that help protect your Windows 7 PC will no longer be available through Intune. Microsoft strongly recommends that you move to Windows 10 before January 2020 to avoid a scenario where you need service or support that is no longer available. Read more about the Windows support lifecycle [here](https://support.microsoft.com/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet).

#### <a name="how-does-this-affect-me"></a>Bu değişiklik beni nasıl etkileyecek?
You are receiving this message because you are currently managing Windows 7 PCs using the legacy Intune PC software agent. Because less than a year remains before the end of Windows 7 extended support, we strongly encourage your organization to begin upgrading to Windows 10 as soon as possible.  

PC management capabilities are built directly into the Windows 10 operating system, and you no longer need to install a client agent such as the Intune software client for Windows 7. Starting with Windows 8.1, Microsoft uses the Mobile Device Management (MDM) architecture to provision, configure, update, and manage Windows PCs. When you have set up Intune, you can simplify Windows enrollment by [enrolling Windows 10 PCs into Intune](..\windows-enroll.md) through the MDM channel. We recommend that you use this "agentless" MDM management solution to manage your Windows 10 PCs.

#### <a name="what-do-i-need-to-do-to-prepare-for-this-change"></a>Bu değişikliğe hazırlanmak için ne yapmam gerek?
We encourage your organization to immediately consider this action plan:

- Plan and upgrade the Windows 7 fleet to Windows 10 before January 14, 2020.
- Explore [Windows 10 deployment support](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/) to learn more about how to upgrade your existing fleet of Windows 7 PCs to Windows 10.
- Review the [Desktop App Assure](https://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack/microsoft-365/desktop-app-assure?rtc=1) offer through FastTrack, which will assist with the Microsoft application compatibility promise.
- Transition existing legacy Intune software client managed devices to the Microsoft-recommended solution to manage Windows 10 using MDM management. Enroll all new Windows 10 PCs using MDM management for Intune in the Azure portal.
