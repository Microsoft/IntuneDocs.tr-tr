# <a name="use-windows-hello-for-business-on-windows-10-devices-with-microsoft-intune"></a>Use Windows Hello for Business on Windows 10 devices with Microsoft Intune

Windows Hello for Business is a method for signing in to Windows devices by replacing passwords, smart cards, and virtual smart cards. Intune includes built-in settings so Administrators can configure and use Windows Hello for Business. For example, you can use these settings to:

- Enable Windows Hello for Business for devices and users
- Set device PIN requirements, including a minimum or maximum PIN length
- Allow gestures, such as a fingerprint, that users can (or can't use) to sign in to devices

Bu özellik şunları çalıştıran cihazlarda geçerlidir:

- Windows 10 ve üzeri
- Windows 10 Mobile
- Windows 10 Holographic for Business

Intune uses "configuration profiles" to create and customize these settings for your organization's needs. After you add these features in a profile, push or deploy these settings to user and device groups in your organization.

This article shows you how to create a device configuration profile. For a list of all the settings, and what they do, see [Windows 10 device settings to enable Windows Hello for Business](identity-protection-windows-settings.md).

## <a name="create-the-device-profile"></a>Create the device profile

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

2. Select **Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile**.

3. Aşağıdaki özellikleri girin:

   - **Ad**: Yeni profil için açıklayıcı bir ad girin.
   - **Açıklama**: Profil için bir açıklama girin. Bu ayar isteğe bağlıdır ancak önerilir.
   - **Platform**: Select **Windows 10 and later**. İş İçin Windows Hello, yalnızca Windows 10 ve üzeri çalıştıran cihazlarda desteklenir.
   - **Profile type**: Select **Identity protection**.

4. On the *Windows Hello for Business* pane, configure the following options:

   - **Configure Windows Hello for Business**: Choose how you want to configure Windows Hello for Business:

     - **Not configured** (default): [Provisions Windows Hello for Business](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-how-it-works-provisioning) on the device. Kimlik koruma profillerini yalnızca kullanıcılara atarken cihaz bağlamı varsayılan olarak **Yapılandırılmadı** olur.

     - **Disabled**: If you don't want to use Windows Hello for Business, select this option. This option disables Windows Hello for Business for all users.

     - **Enabled**: Choose this option to [provision](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-how-it-works-provisioning), and configure Windows Hello for Business settings in Intune. Enter the settings you want to configure. For a list of all settings, and what they do, see - [Windows 10 device settings to enable Windows Hello for Business](identity-protection-windows-settings.md).

   - **Use security keys for sign-in**: Enable Windows Hello security key as a logon credential for all PCs in the tenant.

     - **Enable**
     - **Not configured**  (default)

5. İşiniz bittiğinde **Tamam** > **Oluştur**’u seçerek değişikliklerinizi kaydedin.

The profile is created and appears in the profiles list. Next, [assign](../configuration/device-profile-assign.md) this profile to user and device groups to meet your needs.

## Example of device restriction settings

In this high-level example, you'll create a device restriction policy that blocks the use of the built-in camera app on Android devices.
